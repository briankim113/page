## Personal
Born in South Korea, I have always been “on the go” since I moved to Virginia when I was 9 years old. Since then, I lived in [Italy](https://briankim113.wixsite.com/ciao-italia) and the [United Arab Emirates](https://briankim113.wixsite.com/nyuad) and have documented my experiences here and there.

I am actively running a [book review / reflection blog](https://brianreadsbooks.wordpress.com/), so give it a read!
