## Personal
1. I am actively running a [book review / reflection blog](https://brianreadsbooks.wordpress.com/), so give it a read!
2. I also play the clarinet at a local LA orchestra called the [Heart of Los Angeles Eisner Intergenerational Orchestra](https://www.holaio.org) (HOLA EIO). Please join us if you are a music enthusiast.
3. I have always been "on the go" since I moved from South Korea to Virginia when I was 9 years old. Since then, I lived in [Italy](https://briankim113.wixsite.com/ciao-italia) and the [United Arab Emirates](https://briankim113.wixsite.com/nyuad) and have documented my experiences.
