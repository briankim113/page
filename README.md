## Personal
Born in South Korea, I have always been “on the go” since I moved to Virginia at the age of nine. Since then, I also lived in Italy and the United Arab Emirates. I have documented my experiences in Italy [here](https://briankim113.wixsite.com/ciao-italia) and in the UAE [here](https://briankim113.wixsite.com/nyuad).

I have recently started a book review / reflection blog, so give it a read [here](https://brianreadsbooks.wordpress.com/).
